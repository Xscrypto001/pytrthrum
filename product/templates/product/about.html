        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our company, dedicated to the beauty and utility of Pyrethrum flowers.</p>

        <h2>What are Pyrethrum Flowers?</h2>
        <p>Pyrethrum flowers, also known as Chrysanthemums, are a group of daisy-like flowers that are native to Asia and Europe. They are best known for their ability to produce pyrethrins, natural compounds that have potent insecticidal properties. These vibrant flowers are not only beautiful but also incredibly useful in sustainable agriculture and home gardening.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to harness the natural power of Pyrethrum to create effective, eco-friendly insecticides that provide a safer alternative to synthetic chemicals. We are committed to promoting sustainable practices and protecting the environment through our products.</p>

        <h2>History of Pyrethrum</h2>
        <p>Pyrethrum has been used for centuries as a natural insect repellent. Its use dates back to ancient China and Persia, where it was used to control lice and other pests. In the 19th century, Pyrethrum gained popularity in Europe and America as an effective insecticide for agricultural and household use.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Pyrethrum</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Insecticide:</strong> Pyrethrum contains pyrethrins, which target the nervous system of insects, making it highly effective against a wide range of pests.</li>
            <li><strong>Eco-Friendly:</strong> Pyrethrins degrade rapidly in sunlight and air, minimizing environmental impact and reducing the risk of pollution compared to synthetic insecticides.</li>
            <li><strong>Safe for Humans and Pets:</strong> When used according to instructions, pyrethrum-based products pose minimal risk to humans and animals, making them ideal for use in homes and gardens.</li>
        </ul>
